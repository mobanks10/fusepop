When your legs don't work like they used to before

And I can't sweep you off of your feet

Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love

Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks
And darling I will be loving you 'til we're 70

And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23

And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways

Maybe just the touch of a hand

Oh me I fall in love with you every single day

And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now

Take me into your loving arms

Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars

Place your head on my beating heart

I'm thinking out loud

Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades

And the crowds don't remember my name

When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mm

I know you will still love me the same
'Cause honey your soul can never grow old, it's evergreen

Baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways

Maybe it's all part of a plan

I'll just keep on making the same mistakes

Hoping that you'll understand
But baby now

Take me into your loving arms

Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars

Place your head on my beating heart

I'm thinking out loud

That maybe we found love right where we are, oh
(Ah la la, la la la, la la la, la la la la)
So baby now

Take me into your loving arms

Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars

Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart

 my fight song

Take back my life song

Prove I'm alright song

My power's turned on

Starting right now I'll be strong

I'll play my fight song

And I don't really care if nobody else believes

'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me
Losing friends and I'm chasing sleep

Everybody's worried about me

In too deep

Say I'm in too deep (in too deep)

And it's been two years I miss my home

But there's a fire burning in my bones

Still believe

Yeah, I still believe
And all those things I didn't say

Wrecking balls inside my brain

I will scream them loud tonight

Can you hear my voice this time?
This is my fight song

Take back my life song

Prove I'm alright song

My power's turned on

Starting right now I'll be strong

I'll play my fight song

And I don't really care if nobody else believes

'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me
A lot of fight left in me
Like a small boat

On the ocean

Sending big waves

Into motion

Like how a single word

Can make a heart open

I might only have one match

But I can make an explosion
This is my fight song

Take back my life song

Prove I'm alright song

My power's turned on

Starting right now I'll be strong (I'll be strong)

I'll play my fight song

And I don't really care if nobody else believes

'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me
Know I've still got a lot of fight left in me

Boy, look at me in my face

Tell me that you're not just about this bass

You really think I could be replaced

Nah, I come from outer space

And I'm a classy girl, I'mma hold it up

You're full of something but it ain't love

And what we got, straight overdue

Go find somebody new
You can buy me diamond earrings and deny-ny-ny, ny-ny-ny, deny-ny

But I smell her on your collar so goodbye-bye-bye, bye-bye-bye
I know you lie

'Cause your lips are moving

Tell me do you think I'm dumb?

I might be young, but I ain't stupid

Talking around in circles with your tongue

I gave you bass, you gave me sweet talk

Saying how I'm your number one

But I know you lie

'Cause your lips are moving

Baby don't you know I'm done
If your lips are moving, if your lips are moving

If your lips are moving, then you're lyin', lyin', lyin', baby

If your lips are moving, if your lips are moving

If your lips are moving, then you're lyin', lyin', lyin', baby
Hey baby don't you bring them tears

'Cause it's too late, too late baby

You only love me when you're here

You're so two-faced, two-faced babe
You can buy me diamond earrings and deny-ny-ny, ny-ny-ny, deny-ny

But I smell her on your collar so goodbye-bye-bye, bye-bye-bye

'Cause your lips are moving

Baby don't you know I'm done
You and me, we made a vow

For better or for worse

I can't believe you let me down

But the proof's in a way it hurts
For months on end I've had my doubts

Denying every tear

I wish this would be over now

But I know that I still need you here
You say I'm crazy

'Cause you don't think I know what you've done

But when you call me baby

I know I'm not the only one
You've been so unavailable

Now sadly I know why

Your heart is unobtainable

Even though Lord knows you kept mine
You say I'm crazy

'Cause you don't think I know what you've done

But when you call me baby

I know I'm not the only one
I have loved you for many years

Maybe I am just not enough

You've made me realize my deepest fear

By lying and tearing us up
You say I'm crazy

'Cause you don't think I know what you've done

But when you call me baby

I know I'm not the only one

You say I'm crazy

'Cause you don't think I know what you've done

But when you call me baby

I know I'm not the only one

I know I'm not the only one

I know I'm not the only one

And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, know

I know I'm not the only one

I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass
Yeah it's pretty clear, I ain't no size two

But I can shake it, shake it like I'm supposed to do

'Cause I got that boom boom that all the boys chase

All the right junk in all the right places

I see the magazines working that Photoshop

We know that shit ain't real

Come on now, make it stop

If you got beauty beauty just raise 'em up

'Cause every inch of you is perfect

From the bottom to the top

Yeah, my momma she told me don't worry about your size

She says, boys they like a little more booty to hold at night

You know I won't be no stick-figure, silicone Barbie doll,

So, if that's what's you're into

Then go ahead and move along

Midnight, you come and pick me up, no headlights

Long drive, could end in burning flames or paradise

Fade into view, oh,

It's been a while since I have even heard from you

(Heard from you)

I should just tell you to leave 'cause I

Know exactly where it leads but I

Watch it go round and round each time
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye

And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like

And when we go crashing down, we come back every time

'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

You've got that long hair slick back, white t-shirt

And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt

And when we go crashing down, we come back every time

'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
So it goes, he can't keep his wild eyes on the road

Takes me home, lights are off he's taking off his coat (Hm yeah)

I say "I've heard that you've been out and about with some other girl"

(Some other girl)

He says "What you've heard is true but I

Can't stop thinking about you and I."

I said "I've been there too a few times"
'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye

And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
She is always in my corner
Right there when I want her
All these other girls are tempting
But I'm empty when you're gone
And they say
Do you need me?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do I make you feel like cheating?
And I'm like no, not really cause
Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
She walks like a model
She grants my wishes like a genie in a bottle (Yeah yeah)
'Cause I'm the wizard of love
And I got the magic wand
All these other girls are tempting
But I'm empty when you're gone
And they say
Do you need me?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do I make you feel like cheating?
And I'm like no, not really cause
Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
She gives me love and affection
Baby did I mention, you're the only girl for me
No I don't need a next one
Mama loves you too, she thinks I made the right selection
Now all that's left to do
Is just for me to pop the question
Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
And I know she'll be the death of me, at least we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me, the worst is yet to come
But at least we'll both be beautiful and stay forever young
This I know, yeah, this I know
She told me, don't worry about it
She told me, don't worry no more
We both know we can't go without it
She told me you'll never be in love, oh, oh, woo
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it, oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it, oh
And I know she'll be the death of me, at least we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me, the worst is yet to come
All the misery was necessary when we're deep in love
This I know, girl, I know
She told me, don't worry about it
She told me, don't worry no more
We both know we can't go without it
She told me you'll never be in love, oh, oh, woo
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it, oh
I can't feel my face (I can't feel nothing) when I'm with you
But I love it, (but I love it) but I love it, oh

But I love it, (when I'm with you baby) but I love it, (when I'm with you baby)
I can't feel my fa-
You're the light, you're the night
You're the color of my blood
You're the cure, you're the pain
You're the only thing I wanna touch
Never knew that it could mean so much, so much
You're the fear, I don't care
'Cause I've never been so high
Follow me to the dark
Let me take you past our satellites
You can see the world you brought to life, to life
So love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me li my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power's turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes

I don't know if you were looking at me or not

You probably smile like that all the time

And I don't mean to bother you but

I couldn't just walk by

And not say hi
And I know your name

'Cause everybody in here knows your name

And you're not looking for anything right now

So I don't wanna come on strong

But don't get me wrong

Your eyes are so intimidating

My heart is pounding but

It's just a conversation

No girl I'm not gonna waste it

You don't know me

I don't know you but I want to
And I don't wanna steal your freedom

I don't wanna change your mind

I don't have to make you love me

I just want to take your time
I don't wanna wreck your Friday

I ain't gonna waste my lines

I don't have to take your heart

I just wanna take your time
And I know it starts with hello

And the next thing you know you're trying to be nice

And some guys getting too close

Trying to pick you up

Trying to get you drunk
And I'm sure one of your friends is about to come over here

'Cause she's supposed to save you from random guys

You could have rolled your eyes

Told me to go to hell

Could have walked away

'Cause I got that boom boom that all the boys chase
All the right junk in all the right places
I see the magazines working that Photoshop
We know that shit ain't real
Come on now, make it stop
If you got beauty beauty just raise 'em up
'Cause every inch of you is perfect
From the bottom to the top

Midnight, you come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive, could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh,
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
(Heard from you)
I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads but I
Watch it go round and round each time
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You've got that long hair slick back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
So it goes, he can't keep his wild eyes on the road
Takes me home, lights are off he's taking off his coat (Hm yeah)
I say "I've heard that you've been out and about with some other girl"
(Some other girl)
He says "What you've heard is true but I
Can't stop thinking about you and I."
I said "I've been there too a few times"
'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Bed, stay in bed
The feeling of your skin locked in my head
Smoke, smoke me broke
I don't care I'm down for what you want
Day drunk into the night
Wanna keep you here
Cause you dry my tears
Yeah, summer lovin' and fights
How it is for us
And it's all because
Now if we're talking body
You got a perfect one
So put it on me
Swear it won't take you long

But you will remember me
Remember me for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
(Hey yeah, oh hey, hey yeah)
Remember me for centuries
Mummified my teenage dreams
No, it's nothing wrong with me
The kids are all wrong
The stories are off
Heavy metal broke my heart
Come on, come on and let me in
The bruises on your thighs like my fingerprints
And this is for tonight
I thought that you would feel
I never meant for you to fix yourself
Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries

Don't tell your mother

Kiss one another

Lost souls and reverie

Running wild and running free

Two kids, you and me
And I say

Hey, hey hey hey

Living like we're renegades

Hey hey hey

Hey hey hey

Living like we're renegades

Renegades, renegades

Rebels and mutineers

Go forth and have no fear

Come close the end is near
And I say hey, hey hey hey

Living like we're renegades

Hey hey hey

Hey hey hey

Living like we're renegades

Renegades, renegades
All hail the underdogs

It's our time to break the rules

Let's begin
And I say hey, hey hey hey

Living like we're renegades

Leaving like we're renegades

Renegades, renegades
He said let's get out of this town

Drive out of the city

Away from the crowds

I thought heaven can't help me now

Nothing lasts forever

But this is gonna take me down

He's so tall, and handsome as hell

He's so bad but he does it so well

I can see the end as it begins my one condition is
Say you'll remember me

Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset babe

Red lips and rosy cheeks

Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your wildest dreams (Ah ah)

Wildest dreams (Ah ah)
I said no one has to know what we do

His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room

And his voice is a familiar sound, nothing lasts forever

But this is getting good now

He's so tall, and handsome as hell

He's so bad but he does it so well

And when we've had our very last kiss

But my last request it is
Say you'll remember me

Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset babe

Red lips and rosy cheeks

Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your wildest dreams (Ah ah) (Ah ah)

Wildest dreams (Ah ah)
You see me in hindsight

Tangled up with you all night

Burn it down

Some day when you leave me

I bet these memories hunt you around

You see me in hindsight

Tangled up with you all night

Burn it down (Burn it down)

Some day when you leave me

I bet these memories follow you around (Follow you around)
Say you'll remember me

Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset babe

Red lips and rosy cheeks

Say you'll see me again even if it's just pretend
Say you'll remember me

Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset babe

Red lips and rosy cheeks

Say you'll see me again even if it's just (Just pretend, just pretend) in your wildest dreams (Ah ah)

In your wildest dreams (Ah ah)

Even if it's just in your wildest dreams (Ah ah)

In your wildest dreams (Ah ah)
Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one-night stand

But I still need love 'cause I'm just a man

These nights never seem to go to plan

I don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand?
Oh, won't you stay with me?

'Cause you're all I need

This ain't love it's clear to see

But darling, stay with me
Why am I so emotional?

No it's not a good look, gain some self control

And deep down I know this never works

But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt
Oh, won't you stay with me?

'Cause you're all I need

This ain't love it's clear to see

But darling, stay with me

I can move mountains

I can work a miracle, work a miracle

Oh, oh, keep you like an oath

May nothing but death do us part
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman

Bury me till I confess

She wants to dance like Uma Thurman

And I can't get you out of my head
The stench, the stench, of summer sex

And CK eternity, oh hell yes

Divide me down to the smallest I can be

Put your, put your venom in me

But they're not quite what they seem
I can move mountains

I can work a miracle, work a miracle

Oh, oh, I keep you like an oath

May nothing but death do us part
You'll find your way

And may death find you alive

Take me down the line

In Gem City we turn the tide

She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
Bury me till I confess
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
And I can't get you out of my head
The stench, the stench, of summer sex
And CK eternity, oh hell yes
Divide me down to the smallest I can be
Put your, put your venom in me
I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Oh, oh, I keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us part
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
Bury me till I confess
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman

Uh-uh uh-uh uh-uh

I eat my dinner in my bathtub

Then I go to sex clubs

Watching freaky people getting it on

It doesn't make me nervous

If anything I'm restless

Yeah I've been around and I've seen it all
I get home, I got the munchies

Binge on all my Twinkies

Throw up in the tub, then I go to sleep

And I drank up all my money

Days kind of lonely
You're gone and I got to stay high

All the time to keep you off my mind, ooh ooh

High all the time to keep you off my mind, ooh ooh

Spend my days locked in a haze

Trying to forget you babe, I fall back down

Gotta stay high all my life to forget I'm missing you
Pick up daddies at the playground

How I spend my day time

Loosen up the frown, make them feel alive

I make it fast and greasy

I know my way too easy
You're gone and I got to stay high

All the time to keep you off my mind, ooh ooh

High all the time to keep you off my mind, ooh ooh

Spend my days locked in a haze,

Tryin' to forget you babe, I fall back down

Got to stay high all my life to forget I'm missing you
Staying in my play pretend

Where the fun ain't got no end

Oh, can't go home alone again

Need someone to numb the pain

Got to stay high all my life to forget I'm missing you
Yes I do, I believe

That one day I will be, where I was

Right there, right next to you

And it's hard, the days just seem so dark

The moon, and the stars, are nothing without you

Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?

No words can explain, the way I'm missing you

The night, this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside

These tears, they tell their own story
You told me not to cry when you were gone

But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

Can I lay by your side, next to you, you

And make sure you're alright

I'll take care of you

And I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight
I'm reaching out to you

Can you hear my call? (Who's to say you won't hear me?)

This hurt that I've been through

I'm missing you, missing you like crazy
You told me not to cry when you were gone

But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

Can I lay by your side, next to you, you

And make sure you're alright

I'll take care of you

And I don't wanna be here if I can't be with you tonight

And I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight
I'm reaching out to you
 guess that I don't want to either

But me and her we make money the same way

Four cities, two planes the same day

And those shows have never been what its about

Maybe well go together and just figure it out

I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch

But we should get on the plane or we'll be missing it now

Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out

When she was kissing him how

I was confused about

She should figure it out

Why I'm sat here singing
Don't with my love

That heart is so cold

All over my own

I don't wanna know that babe

Don't fuck with my love

I told her, she knows

Take aim and reload

I don't wanna know that babe
On my hotel door

I don't even know if she knows what for

She was crying on my shoulder

I already told you

Trust and respect is what we do this for

I never intended to be next

But you didn't need to to take him to bed, that's all

And I never saw him as a threat

Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course

Its not like we were both on tour

We were staying on the same hotel floor

And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment

But it was never just fun and I thought you were different

This is not the way you realize that you want it

It's a bit too much too late if I'm honest

And all this time God knows I'm singing
Don't fuck with my love

That heart is so cold

All over my own

I don't wanna know that babe

Don't fuck with my love

I told her, she knows

Take aim and reload

I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love

That heart is so cold

All over my own

I don't wanna know that babe

Don't fuck with my love

I told her, she knows

Take aim and reload

I don't wanna know that babe
I keep going to the river to pray

'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain

And at most

I'm sleeping all these demons away

But your ghost, the ghost of you

It keeps me awake
My friends I can figure out

You're the soul that's inside of you

It's rock hard in another you

But your evil was coming through
These eyes sitting on the wall

Well they watch every move I make

Bright light taking in the shape

You go hard, makes my spirit shake
(Ooh) I had to go through hell to prove I'm not insane

Had to meet the devil just to know his name
And that's when my love was burning

Yeah it's still burning
I keep going to the river to pray

'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain

And at most

I'm sleeping all these demons away

But your ghost, the ghost of you

It keeps me awake
I keep going to the river to pray

'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain

And at most

I'm sleeping all these demons away

But your ghost, the ghost of you

It keeps me awake
Each time that I think you go

I turn around and you're creeping in

And I let you another skin

'Cause I love living in the sin
Oh you never told me

True love was gonna hurt

True pain, it's own desert

True face that I never learned
(Ooh) I keep going to the river to pray

'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain

And at most

I'm sleeping all these demons away

But your ghost, the ghost of you

It keeps me awake
I keep going to the river to pray

'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain

And at most

I'm sleeping all these demons away

But your ghost, the ghost of you

It keeps me awake
Give up the ghost

Give up the ghost

Give up the ghost

Stall the haunting baby
Give up the ghost

Give up the ghost

Give up the ghost

No more haunting baby
I keep going to the river
I keep going to the river to pray

'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain

And at most

I'm sleeping all these demons away

But your ghost, the ghost of you

It keeps me awake
I keep going to the river to pray

'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain

And at most

I'm sleeping all these demons away

But your ghost, the ghost of you

It keeps me awake
(I guess right now you've got the last laugh)
I'm sorry if I seem uninterested

Or I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent

Truly, I ain't got no business here

But since my friends are here

I just came to kick it but really

I would rather be at home all by myself not in this room

With people who don't even care about my well being

I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend

So you can go back, please enjoy your party

I'll be here, somewhere in the corner under clouds of marijuana

With this boy who's hollering I can hardly hear

Over this music I don't listen to and I don't wanna get with you

So tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh oh

I ask myself what am I doing here?

Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here

And I can't wait till we can break up outta here
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this

An anti social pessimist but usually I don't mess with this

And I know you mean only the best and

Your intentions aren't to bother me

But honestly I'd rather be

Somewhere with my people we can kick it and just listen

To some music with the message (like we usually do)

And we'll discuss our big dreams

How we plan to take over the planet

So pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand

That I'll be here

Not there in the kitchen with the girl

Who's always gossiping about her friends

So tell them I'll be here

Right next to the boy who's throwing up 'cause

He can't take what's in his cup no more

Oh God why am I here?
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh oh

I ask myself what am I doing here?

Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here

And I can't wait till we can break up outta here
Hours later congregating next to the refrigerator

Some girl's talking 'bout her haters

She ain't got none

How did it ever come to this

I shoulda never come to this

So holla at me I'll be in the car when you're done

I'm standoffish, don't want what you're offering

And I'm done talking

Awfully sad it had to be that way

So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready

And I'm standing by the TV with my beanie low

Yo I'll be over here
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh oh

I ask myself what am I doing here?

Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here

And I can't wait till we can break up outta here
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Going out tonight

Changes into something red

Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress

Everything she never had she's showing off
Driving too fast

Moon is breaking through her hair

She said it was something that she won't forget

Having no regrets is all that she really wants
We're only getting older baby

And I've been thinking about it lately

Does it ever drive you crazy

Just how fast the night changes?

Everything that you've ever dreamed of

Disappearing when you wake up

But there's nothing to be afraid of

Even when the night changes

It will never change me and you
Chasing it tonight,

Doubts are running 'round her head

He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette

Heart is beating loud, she doesn't want it to stop
Moving too fast

Moon is lighting up her skin

She's falling, doesn't even know it yet

Having no regrets is all that she really wants
We're only getting older baby

And I've been thinking about it lately

Does it ever drive you crazy

Just how fast the night changes?

Everything that you've ever dreamed of

Disappearing when you wake up

But there's nothing to be afraid of

Even when the night changes

It will never change me and you
Going out tonight

Changes into something red

Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress

Reminds her of a missing piece of innocence she lost
We're only getting older baby

And I've been thinking about it lately

Does it ever drive you crazy

Just how fast the night changes?

Everything that you've ever dreamed of

Disappearing when you wake up

But there's nothing to be afraid of

Even when the night changes

It will never change, baby

It will never change, baby

It will never change me and you
Oh man

Oh man, oh man

Not again
Yeah, I learned the game from William Wesley, you can never check me

Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message

Back to back like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon

Back to back like I'm Jordan '96, '97 whoa

Very important and very pretentious

When I look back I might be mad that I gave this attentiCan you hear my call? (Who's to say you won't hear me?)
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy
You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
And I don't wanna be here if I can't be with you tonight

You say he's doing his thing, though
Hit the Quan, hit the Quan, hit the Quan, hit the Quan
I said get down low and swing your arm
I said get down low and hit the Quan
I'm finna show you how to
Hit the Quan, hit the Quan, hit the Quan, hit the Quan
I said get down low and swing your arm
I said get down low and hit the Quan
You're on the couch, blowing up my phone
You don't want to come out, but you don't want to be alone
It don't take but two to have a little soirée
If you're in the mood, sit tight right where you are, babe
'Cause I'll be at your door in ten minutes
Whatever you got on, girl, stay in it
You ain't gotta leave the house to have a good time
I'mma bring the good time home to you
We'll have a house party, we don't need nobody
Turn your TV off, break that boom-box out
We'll wake up all the neighbours 'til the whole block hates us
And the cops will show up and try to shut us down
If you're gonna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party
If you wanna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party
Throw a guess that I don't want to either
But me and her we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes the same day
And those shows have never been what its about
Maybe well go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch
But we should get on the plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him how
I was confused about
She should figure it out
Why I'm sat here singing
Don't with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder
I already told you
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course
Its not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realize that you want it
It's a bit too much too late if I'm honest
And all this time God knows I'm singing
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most
I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake
My friends I can figure out
You're the soul that's inside of you
It's rock hard in another you
But your evil was coming through
These eyes sitting on the wall
Well they watch every move I make
Bright light taking in the shape
You go hard, makes my spirit shake
(Ooh) I had to go through hell to prove I'm not insane
Had to meet the devil just to know his name
And that's when my love was burning
Yeah it's still burning
I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most
I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake
I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most
I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake
Each time that I think you go
I turn around and you're creeping in
And I let you another skin
'Cause I love living in the sin
Oh you never told me
True love was gonna hurt
True pain, it's own desert
True face that I never learned
(Ooh) I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most
I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake
I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most
I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake
Give up the ghost
Give up the ghost
Give up the ghost
Stall the haunting baby
Give up the ghost
Give up the ghost
Give up the ghost
No more haunting baby
I keep going to the river
I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most
I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake
I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most
I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake
(I guess right now you've got the last laugh)
I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent
Truly, I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here
I just came to kick it but really
I would rather be at home all by myself not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here, somewhere in the corner under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to and I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh oh
I ask myself what am I doing here?
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here
And I can't wait till we can break up outta here
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti social pessimist but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best and
Your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people we can kick it and just listen
To some music with the message (like we usually do)
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand
That I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen with the girl
Who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwing up 'cause
He can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh oh
I ask myself what am I doing here?
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here
And I can't wait till we can break up outta here
Hours later congregating next to the refrigerator
Some girl's talking 'bout her haters
She ain't got none
How did it ever come to this
I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm standoffish, don't want what you're offering
And I'm done talking
Awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standing by the TV with my beanie low
Yo I'll be over here
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh oh
I ask myself what am I doing here?
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here
And I can't wait till we can break up outta here
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Going out tonight
Changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had she's showing off
Driving too fast
Moon is breaking through her hair
She said it was something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants
We're only getting older baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you
Chasing it tonight,
Doubts are running 'round her head
He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud, she doesn't want it to stop
Moving too fast
Moon is lighting up her skin
She's falling, doesn't even know it yet
Having no regrets is all that she really wants
We're only getting older baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you
Going out tonight
Changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Reminds her of a missing piece of innocence she lost
We're only getting older baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change, baby
It will never change, baby
It will never change me and you
Oh man
Oh man, oh man
Not again
Yeah, I learned the game from William Wesley, you can never check me
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
Back to back like I'm Jordan '96, '97 whoa
Very important and very pretentious
When I look back I might be mad that I gave this attenti
